Static site for my collections and thoughts
### Collections of Items and Tinkering
This site is a place for me to gather and collect my various tinkering projects as I transition between my old life and new.
It's a central place to reference all the bookmarks I've collected over time with some comments. Projects I've started and worked on as a result of these links I'll also reference here so that it's all nicely bundled together.
It's always going to be work in progress as my skills develop and I learn new ones.

Thus far, there'll be R code, Python code, Ruby code and Ruby on Rails apps.
It's also a place to reference realy awesome plots I've managed to create or want to create in the future.
There might be some Tableau stuff thrown in and, very likely, so other non-techy-type stuff too.

If you happen to not be me, feel free to browse, fork or clone anything I've got here and if you have any questions, feel free to contact me on:
