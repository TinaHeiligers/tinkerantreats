Following are the reasons this site exists.


<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
In this post I explain why I created this website, what it's about and who it's intended for. As the site grows (or changes), I'll try to document my reasoning in making these changes.

I'm following the official [pelican](pelican.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content.html) read the docs guide to using pelican for making a static site.

### Why this site?

----------------------------------
The obvious question some folks might ask if they happen to stumble across this particular site is: "Why? What's this all about?".

I'll tell you straight: This site is for me to get organized!

There's so much I'm learning and _have learnt_ up to now, that I needed a place other than my in-box to reflect on on it all. Yes, there's a lot  all on github but that doesn't help me string it all together.

Never mind all the useful links, articles and tutorials I've book marked and just haven't gotten 'round to yet. Bookmarks are only useful if they're followed up within a day or two, not, as has been the case thus far, lying there for more than three months.

I needed somewhere to link to apps I've built, code I've written and analysis I've done. I wanted someplace safe to put my plots and maps and graphs, course notes, personal stumblings and "wins" and perhaps just to write!

So, that's why this is here.

As a warning to my future self: this ain't a dedicated tech blog, nor is it a place to 'advertise my skills'. It's a personal space for me to put everything together in ONE place. There's another blog for 'marketing-myself' stuff yet to be built, but for now, I'll stick with [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christianeheiligers).

Oh yes, there may be the odd actual _food_ recipe too..
