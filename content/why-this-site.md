Following are the reasons this site exists.


<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
In this post I explain why I created this website, what it's about and who it's intended for. As the site grows (or changes), I'll try to document my reasoning in making these changes.

I'm following the official pelican read the docs guide to using pelican for making a sstatic site. I ended off after creating the applican and generating the first article, this one.

### Why this site?

----------------------------------
The obvious question some folks might ask if they happen to stumble across this particular site is: "Why? What's this all about?".

I'll tell you straight: This site is for me, it's for my peace of mind and for me to get organised!

There's so much I'm learning and _have learnt_ up to now, that I need a place to relfect on on it all. Yes, it's all on github but that doesn't help me string it all together.

Nevermind all the useful links, articles and tutorials I've bookmarked and just haven't gotten 'round to yet. Bookmarks are only useful if they're followed up within a day or two, not, as has been the case thus far, lying there for more than three months.

I want somewhere to reflect on apps I've built (with links to them, of course), code I've written and analyses I've done. I want somewhere to put my plots and maps and graphs, somewhere to put my notes on courses, personal stumblings and triamfs and perhaps just to write!

So, that's why this is here.

As a warning to my future self: this ain't a dedicated tech blog, nor is it a place to 'advertise my skills'. It's a personal space for me to put everything together in ONE place. There's another blog for 'marketing-myself' stuff, it's [here](https://tinaheiligers.github.io)

Yes, there may be the odd actual _food_ recipe too..
