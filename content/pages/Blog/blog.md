### Ruby D Camp, 2016

----------------------------------

Neither rain nor cold could dampen the warm, kind, sharing environment at [Ruby D Camp](http://rubydcamp.org/about.html) this weekend. Code and camping and 77 other Ruby enthusiasts made for an experience not to be forgotten! 
We cooked together, we coded together, we chatted and laughed together. We played board games in the evening after intensive day-long discussions where everyone had a voice.

I've never been to a conference from which I learnt so much. Not just about code but also about people who code, their journeys, common concerns and internal conflicts. 

I knew it would be an internal challenge, bordering on a personal 'risk' of exposing how new I am to this tech world in a setting where one cannot hide! 

As it turns out, I wasn't alone. The number of self-acclaimed newbies who bit the bullet and joined the camp was impressive, as was the number of the female gender who took up the challenge of roughing it out in the woods.
In fact, on the last night after most folks had returned to their homely comforts, the 'die-hard' club consisted mostly of women! 

While my burning questions remain unanswered, I can now proudly say that I feel part of community support.

Thanks Ruby DCamp MMXVI!
