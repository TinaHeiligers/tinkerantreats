## Server Stuff
### Connecting to a server

Under the Infermadiks project, we have a droplet with Digital Ocean. I'm to use this server to set up a PostgressSQL database.
[Connecting](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-digitalocean-console-to-access-your-droplet) isn't difficult once the ssh is set up, which it is.

From there, zsh displayes where I'm at.

### Setting up a db:
We should have [PostgreSQL](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-postgresql-on-ubuntu-16-04) installed on the server. Setting up user accounts and new databases is covered in the same link.

Some more code snippets and [tutorials](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/17-short-tutorials-all-data-scientists-should-read-and-practice) recommended for working through on Data Science by Data Science Central.

They give links to cheetsheets too for [Python](http://www.astro.up.pt/~sousasag/Python_For_Astronomers/Python_qr.pdf), [the NumPy, SciPy and Pandas](https://s3.amazonaws.com/quandl-static-content/Documents/Quandl+-+Pandas,+SciPy,+NumPy+Cheat+Sheet.pdf) family, [R functions for regression](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Ricci-refcard-regression.pdf) and a very nifty one to check out is the [cross reference between R, Python and Matlab](http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/matlab-python-xref.pdf).
