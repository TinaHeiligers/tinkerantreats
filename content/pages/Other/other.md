## Server Stuff
### Connecting to a server

Under the Infermadiks project, we have a droplet with Digital Ocean. I'm to use this server to set up a PostgressSQL database.
[Connecting](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-digitalocean-console-to-access-your-droplet) isn't difficult once the ssh is set up, which it is.

From there, zsh displayes where I'm at.

### Setting up a db:
We should have [PostgreSQL](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-postgresql-on-ubuntu-16-04) installed on the server. Setting up user accounts and new databases is covered in the same link.
