# Women in Tech
A very informative visualization of the impact of pitching computers to boys at an early stage shows that it had a massive impact on the gender balance, or rather, imbalance in the field:

I made an animated gif to explain why [female Earthlings stopped coding](https://twitter.com/ZoggTheAlien/status/707334009475481602/photo/1) in 1984. pic.twitter.com/O2fFBuUe7m"

[The imposter syndrome](https://thedesignteam.io/the-imposter-ddbe96b14e14#.jrads4ayg) is something we may all have felt at some stage or another. If you don't know what the syndrome means, good for you!. If, however, you do, the cartoon is a great help!

# Server Stuff
## Connecting to a server

Under the Infermadiks project, we have a droplet with Digital Ocean. I'm to use this server to set up a PostgressSQL database.
[Connecting](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-digitalocean-console-to-access-your-droplet) isn't difficult once the ssh is set up, which it is.

From there, zsh displays where I'm at.

## Setting up a db:
We should have [PostgreSQL](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-postgresql-on-ubuntu-16-04) installed on the server. Setting up user accounts and new databases is covered in the same link.

Interacting with PostgreSQL using the [asyncio](https://magicstack.github.io/asyncpg/current/) framework in python is covered in the docs for the library.

# Hadoop

# Code snippets:
[14 useful code snippets](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/xn/detail/6448529:BlogPost:454184)

Some more code snippets and [tutorials](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/17-short-tutorials-all-data-scientists-should-read-and-practice) recommended for working through on Data Science by Data Science Central.

They give links to cheat sheets too for [Python](http://www.astro.up.pt/~sousasag/Python_For_Astronomers/Python_qr.pdf), [the NumPy, SciPy and Pandas](https://s3.amazonaws.com/quandl-static-content/Documents/Quandl+-+Pandas,+SciPy,+NumPy+Cheat+Sheet.pdf) family, [R functions for regression](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Ricci-refcard-regression.pdf) and a very nifty one to check out is the [cross reference between R, Python and Matlab](http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/matlab-python-xref.pdf).

# Data Science Topics
The Data Incubator offers an extensive program, geared at transforming science PhD's into Data Scientists. They offer fellowships every year and space is limited, so the program is extremely competitive. The application process is intense! I know, I've gone through it once, didn't get in but am going to go through it again.
Once in, the immersion takes over your life but it's well worth it. In their "we regret to inform you..." email, they offer advise in the form of the following blog posts:

1. [Processing Data](http://blog.thedataincubator.com/2015/01/processing-data-like-a-professional-data-scientist/)

2. [Efficient Numerical Computation](http://blog.thedataincubator.com/2015/01/a-cs-degree-for-data-science-part-i-efficient-numerical-computation/)

3. [Ideas for data science projects 1](http://blog.thedataincubator.com/2014/10/data-sources-for-cool-data-science-projects-part-1/)

4. [Ideas for data science projects 2](http://blog.thedataincubator.com/2014/10/data-sources-for-cool-data-science-projects-part-2/)

5. [How to prepare for The Data Incubator](http://blog.thedataincubator.com/2014/09/how-to-prepare-for-the-data-incubator/)

These cover the minimum requirements of preparation for the next round of applications. In "How to prepare for the Data Incubator", 5 key topics of 'must-have-skills' are outlined, including:

An excellent overview of a fantastic final capstone project on [Rap Analysis](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/our-berkeley-data-science-capstone-project-rap-analysis) is an inspirational read.

# Data frames
[Pandas tutorial on you tube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w26x-z-BdWQ) and the [code](https://github.com/estimate/pandas-exercises) to follow along.

# Visualization
On the [Data Incubator website](http://blog.thedataincubator.com/2014/09/how-to-prepare-for-the-data-incubator/), they give links to useful libraries to cover each topic mentioned above.

# Statistics and Regression
3D linear regression is explained very well in [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24747643/3d-linear-regression) Stack Overflow Q&A post. It's a definite must read and follow along!

#Old Jeek Job Searches
Admit it, it's tough finding a job anywhere, in advanced fields. Tech is no different and it gets even more difficult if you're older and recently went from a PhD Physicist to a newb in programming. Fear not, keep [looking](https://oldgeekjobs.com/), eventually, someone's gotta hire you, right?
