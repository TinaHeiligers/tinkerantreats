# Women in Tech
A very informative visualisation of the impact of pitching computers to boys at an early stage shows that it had a massive impact on the gender balance, or rather, imbalance in the field:

# Server Stuff
## Connecting to a server

Under the Infermadiks project, we have a droplet with Digital Ocean. I'm to use this server to set up a PostgressSQL database.
[Connecting](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-digitalocean-console-to-access-your-droplet) isn't difficult once the ssh is set up, which it is.

From there, zsh displayes where I'm at.

## Setting up a db:
We should have [PostgreSQL](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-postgresql-on-ubuntu-16-04) installed on the server. Setting up user accounts and new databases is covered in the same link.

Interacting with PostgreSQL using the [asyncio](https://magicstack.github.io/asyncpg/current/) framework in python is covered in the docs for the library.

# Hadoop

# Code snippets:
[14 useful code snippets](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/xn/detail/6448529:BlogPost:454184)

Some more code snippets and [tutorials](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/17-short-tutorials-all-data-scientists-should-read-and-practice) recommended for working through on Data Science by Data Science Central.

They give links to cheetsheets too for [Python](http://www.astro.up.pt/~sousasag/Python_For_Astronomers/Python_qr.pdf), [the NumPy, SciPy and Pandas](https://s3.amazonaws.com/quandl-static-content/Documents/Quandl+-+Pandas,+SciPy,+NumPy+Cheat+Sheet.pdf) family, [R functions for regression](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Ricci-refcard-regression.pdf) and a very nifty one to check out is the [cross reference between R, Python and Matlab](http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/matlab-python-xref.pdf).

# Data Science Topics
The Data Incubator offers an immersive program, geared at transforming science PhD's into Data Scientists. They offer fellowships every year and space is limited, so the program is extremely competitive. The spplication process is intense! I know, I've gone through it once, didn't get in but am going to go through it again.
Once in, the immersion takes over your life but it's well worth it. In their "we regret to inform you..." email, they offer advise in the form of the following blog posts:

1. [Processing Data](http://blog.thedataincubator.com/2015/01/processing-data-like-a-professional-data-scientist/)

2. [Efficient Numerical Computation](http://blog.thedataincubator.com/2015/01/a-cs-degree-for-data-science-part-i-efficient-numerical-computation/)

3. [Ideas for data science projects 1](http://blog.thedataincubator.com/2014/10/data-sources-for-cool-data-science-projects-part-1/)

4. [Ideas for data science projects 2](http://blog.thedataincubator.com/2014/10/data-sources-for-cool-data-science-projects-part-2/)

5. [How to prepare for The Data Incubator](http://blog.thedataincubator.com/2014/09/how-to-prepare-for-the-data-incubator/)

These cover the minimum requirements of preperation for the next round of applications. In "How to prepare for the Data Incubator", 5 key topics of 'must-have-skills' are outlined, including:

An excellent overview of a fantastic final capstone project on [Rap Analysis](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/our-berkeley-data-science-capstone-project-rap-analysis) is an inspirational read.
# Scraping

# SQL

# Data frames ([Pandas tutorial on you tube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w26x-z-BdWQ) and the [code](https://github.com/estimate/pandas-exercises) to follow along).

# Machine Learning
Machine learning, is it's raw essence is either classification or prediction problems. These are done using algorithms stemmed from raw maths. If you understand the maths, the rest is simply coding it all together!

Here's a link to a linear classification problem in python: '<{Python_stuff.md}../Python/Python_stuff.md>'

# Visualization
On the [page](http://blog.thedataincubator.com/2014/09/how-to-prepare-for-the-data-incubator/) they give links to useful libraries to cover each topic mentioned.

# Statistics and Regression
3D linear regression is explained very well in [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24747643/3d-linear-regression) Stack Overflow Q&A post. It's a definate must read and follow along!
