Title: ML and AI

Category: Machine Learning and Artificial Intellegence.

These were brief paragraphs and links scattered throughout the pages on this site and it became high time to gather these concepts together in their own category.

There may be some repetition here, since the following was literally copied and pasted below.
If there is anyone who reads this and is kind enough to point out where it becomes annoying, please let me know!

Both R and Python are used in the links that follow.

# Machine Learning
Machine learning, is it's raw essence is either classification or prediction problems. These are done using algorithms stemmed from raw maths. If you understand the maths, the rest is simply coding it all together!

# Overview
Basically, machine learning problems can be split into two fields: classification and prediction. Classification is supervised learning where we want to find the similarity between variables where supervision ocmes into play in that the training set has been classified already.
Prediction is generally unsupervised learning, where we want to predict an outcome based on some data.

Useful resources for dealing with factors or factor-like variables in a machine learning algorithm are:

1. [One-hot/One-of-k](http://code-factor.blogspot.com/2012/10/one-hotone-of-k-data-encoder-for.html) Data Encoder for Machine Learning.

2. [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)

3. [OneHotEncoder](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html) within the scikit learn library.

4. Converting [categorical data](http://fastml.com/converting-categorical-data-into-numbers-with-pandas-and-scikit-learn/) into numbers with Pandas and Scikit-learn


## Common algorithms
Analytics Vidhya did it again with a fantastic [post](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/09/full-cheatsheet-machine-learning-algorithms/) giving both R and python code for 10 most commonly used machine learning algorithms.
It covers just the basics, but is a great start!
Algorithms covered:

1. Linear Regression

2. Logistic regressing

3. Decision Tree

4. SVM (Support Vector Machine)

5. Naive Bayes

6. kNN (k-Nearest Neighbors)

7. k-Means

8. Random Forest

9. Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms

10. Gradient Boosting & AdaBoost.

The R code is concise and there are a few lines of comments describing what the code does but msot of the pseudocode is given in the Python code section. It's referenced again on that page.


## Linear classification
An example of linear classification of [images of cats and dogs](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/08/22/an-intro-to-linear-classification-with-python/) is given in this excellent work-through tutorial.
The tutorial makes extensive use of the scikit-learn library and numpy. Pandas is not used.

## Machine Learning - taken seriously
Going from knowling almost nothing to using machine learning in a "day-job" (if you're lucky enough to have one of those illusive things) can be done. Apparently, it can be done within a year. If taken seriously, very, very seriously!
Mr Borgen articulate his journey down this road very well in a [blog](https://medium.com/learning-new-stuff/machine-learning-in-a-year-cdb0b0ebd29c#.d3ggjur7t) post that starts with some Python code snippets. It's eye catching, a great read and makes it sound like a breeze at first. Then the nerves set in as one begins to realise the dedication, time and commitment it takes to venture up this very, very steep learning curve.
However, it can be done, like anything else, it's possible if broken down into steps, the first of which is reading his how-to-guide on [ML in a week](https://medium.com/learning-new-stuff/machine-learning-in-a-week-a0da25d59850#.n7uc79x7m).


#AI
What to write a few lines of Python following the PEP8 style guide? Then dive into this code that uses AI to get a bot to [reach 133/3131 in a Tron](http://kootenpv.github.io/2016-09-07-ai-challenge-in-78-lines) game. Apparently, there are other bots that have been written using many, many more lines of code, so it's an informative read.
