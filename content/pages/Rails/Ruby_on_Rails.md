I'm busy creating my own apps, for now though, take a peak at [some](https://github.com/TinaHeiligers/) I've developed as part of a full-stack specialization.

These start with the basics, storing [places and images](https://github.com/TinaHeiligers/places), moving on to how to use [geolocations](https://github.com/TinaHeiligers/zips) within an app. Then getting a bit more complex with using a Mongo DB for unstructured data. The first of two uses [grid_fs_files](https://github.com/TinaHeiligers/grid_fs_files), the second app works with linking data from [triathlons](https://github.com/TinaHeiligers/raceday) to people, places and race results.

I will be building my own shortly, but still need many more skills to get to a point where I'll be "gutsy" enough to dive head-long into it.

That being said, things change daily, so one never knows which way the wind might blow...
