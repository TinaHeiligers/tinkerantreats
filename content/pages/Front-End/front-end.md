My latest study immersion is making things look good. Playing with layouts, color schemes, responsive sizing etc is challenging, takes time (it's all rather frustrating having an alignment issue with 1 px!) but is fun.
Some useful resources are:

1. [Twitter](http://getbootstrap.com/) bootstrap docs.

2. [CodePen](https://codepen.io/enxaneta/full/adLPwv/) for handy snippets.

3. [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/) bootstrap.

4. [Flexbox](http://flexbox.io/) tutorials.

I haven't used the Semantic bootstrap yet, been using the twitter one but hope to get to that somewhere between all the other projects.

There's a really good set of [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_BrfH10OTc&list=PL0qaQSYB_0TD-7tNkfMnJ0DCFJVjBNF8G) by BoostrapBay that goes through some basics of using the twitter bootstrap functionality. It's pretty amazing how little styling one has to mess with to make a page look good!.

The flexbox tutorials are also great and have code-along sessions. The "before" and "after" code is also provided, in case you get lost somewhere along the line.
