My latest study immersion is making things look good. Playing with layouts, color schemes, responsive sizing etc is challenging, takes time (it's all rather frustrating having an alignment issue with 1 px!) but is fun.
Some useful resources are:
1. [Twitter](http://getbootstrap.com/) bootstrap docs.
2. [CodePen] flexbox (https://codepen.io/enxaneta/full/adLPwv/)
3. [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/) bootstrap.

I haven't used the Semantic bootstrap yet, been using the twitter on but hope to get to that somewhere between all the other projects.

There's a realy good set of [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_BrfH10OTc&list=PL0qaQSYB_0TD-7tNkfMnJ0DCFJVjBNF8G) by BoostrapBay that goes through some basics of using the twitter bootstrap functionality. It's pretty amazing how little styling one has to mess with to make a page look good!.
