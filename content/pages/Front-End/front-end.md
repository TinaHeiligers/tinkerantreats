Title: Front End Web Development

My latest study immersion is making things look good. Playing with layouts, color schemes, responsive sizing etc is challenging, takes time (it's all rather frustrating having an alignment issue with 1 px!) but is fun.
Some useful resources are:

1. [Twitter](http://getbootstrap.com/) bootstrap docs.

2. [CodePen](https://codepen.io/enxaneta/full/adLPwv/) for handy snippets.

3. [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/) bootstrap.

4. [Flexbox](http://flexbox.io/) tutorials.

5. [10 tools that make life easier](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/from-design-to-development-10-tools-i-cant-live-without-96006445e636#.cbi9yuyr8)

I haven't used the Semantic bootstrap yet, been using the twitter one but hope to get to that somewhere between all the other projects.

There's a really good set of [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_BrfH10OTc&list=PL0qaQSYB_0TD-7tNkfMnJ0DCFJVjBNF8G) by BoostrapBay that goes through some basics of using the twitter bootstrap functionality. It's pretty amazing how little styling one has to mess with to make a page look good!.

The flexbox tutorials are also great and have code-along sessions. The "before" and "after" code is also provided, in case you get lost somewhere along the line.

Thanks to [Johathan Z White](https://twitter.com/JonathanZWhite), the 10 tools he shares with us are fantastic! Items covered include Atom as an IDE, [DragDis](https://dragdis.com/) for saving inspirational items to [Noize.io](http://noiz.io/) that allows one to add ambiance to a 'scene'. There are otehr collaborative platforms and such that are mentioned in the blog, so it's worth the time borwsing through these when embarking on a Front-End project.
