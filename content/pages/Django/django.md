#What is Django?
According to the official [Django project website](https://www.djangoproject.com/), Django is a "high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design".
Django is to Python as Rails is to Ruby, both designed for a particular programming language, both open source and hence, both free. 

#Django quick set-up guides
Amos Omondi wrote a very easy-to-follow guide on how to set a functional app up using the Django framework in his code-along blog [post](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-your-first-python-and-django-application). He gives screen shots of what stuff should look like as one works through the process, code to add to the various scripts and leaves one with (hopefully) an app that has a home and about page.
Another great resource for getting the nuts and bolts fastened but with different 'flavors' is [GoDjango.com](https://godjango.com/). THere's a host of others, just 'Google' them as needed.
