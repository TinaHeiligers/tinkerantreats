<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
I'm a person, a human and, oh yes, a scientist. To prove it, here's a [graphic](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/three-periodic-tables-for-data-scientists) that tickles me pink! It's something a scientist/coder would appreciate.

Well, I have a PhD in Physics, so by formal training, I'm a doctor of physics.

More importantly, I'm just plain curious, a sucker for learning and love a challenge.

Experience has told me there's so much to learn it can get overwhelming, but it's part of the fun of life!

Who would have thought, 6 months ago, that this site would be up? I certainly didn't but here it is and it's evolving daily.
